      <h1>About the Time Capsule</h1>
      <p>Papadrew's Time Capsule is a digital platform that allows users to store memories, messages, photos, and documents securely to be opened at a future date. Designed with privacy and ease-of-use in mind, it serves as a bridge between the past and the future, enabling people to connect with their future selves or loved ones in a meaningful way.</p>
      
      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p>Creating a time capsule with Papadrew's Tools is simple, secure, and meaningful. Here's how it works:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Sign Up:</strong> Users start by creating an account, providing them with a personal space to create and manage their time capsules.</li>
        <li><strong>Create Your Capsule:</strong> Users can then start creating their time capsule by uploading files, writing messages, and adding digital content that holds personal significance.</li>
        <li><strong>Set Your Date:</strong> Once the content is added, users set a future date for when the capsule can be opened. This can be months, years, or even decades into the future.</li>
        <li><strong>Seal It:</strong> With the date set, the capsule is sealed. The content will remain inaccessible until the specified open date arrives.</li>
        <li><strong>Revisit in the Future:</strong> When the open date is reached, the capsule becomes available to the user (and anyone else the user has chosen to share access with), revealing the preserved memories and messages.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h2>File Uploads</h2>
      <p>The time capsule supports a variety of file types for upload, including photos, videos, PDF documents, and text files. Our platform ensures that all files are securely stored and will be exactly as you left them when the capsule is opened in the future.</p>
      
      <p>Whether you're looking to send a message to your future self, preserve memories for future generations, or give a unique gift to someone special, Papadrew's Time Capsule offers a unique way to capture and cherish life's moments.</p>
